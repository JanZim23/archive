Rapping since 11, Austin Henry (also known as MARI GETI) has touched upon outerspace, cycles of abuse, love, ego, robberies, landlords, the animal kingdom n everything in between. Writing, composing, mixing, art, mastering on trains n in bedrooms- drums and synth are synthesized from voices, pots and pans. Childhood inspirations Outkast, Éthiopiques and The Beatles have impacted their sound. MARI GETI shows are primal, cathartic, danc-y n crowd response oriented.
