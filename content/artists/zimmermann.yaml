  I was born in Berlin Germany in January 1997, after some years at a German school I switched to an English-speaking
  school and never looked back. Since a very early age it had been my dream to go to the United States for University
  and become a programmer. After being introduced to coding through various experimentation with Minecraft I thought
  myself Java when I was 15. In high school I picked Music as a concentration and made great friends in the class of 5
  people. We decided to build a basement studio out of all the combined equipment we could find, my job was to build it.
  For the first time I enjoyed making music after having dreaded going to Piano lessons for years. In retrospect, I am
  very glad that my parents encouraged me to keep going with them. Just before finishing the International Baccalaureate
  I happened to go on a campus tour of Northeastern University when visiting Boston as a Tourist. I decided to give it a
  shot and applied for undergraduate. When I found the combined major or Computer Science and Music I couldnâ€™t believe
  my eyes and thought that it would be perfect for me.


  The five years I spent at Northeastern were certainly my most transformative, but I also realized that I would want to
  be coding for the rest of my life. I have great respect for all people that pursue music as a career, it is not for me.

      I created Content for my Fall 2019 Composition for Electronic Instruments course. I recorded two very odd interviews
      with my friends Matt and Hayley and asked them questions on the spot that most people would not have an immediate
      answer to. The message I tried to convey was the extent to which the editing and selection of short clips would
      distort the meaning that they were trying to convey.

      JMS is a collaboration between Rupert Knoop and I. The iterative process of recording some samples, remixing them
      and then rerecording was a great amount of fun. We ended up with a piece that starts and moves forward without ever
      going back. All that was needed was some Midi tracks, a guitar and a piano.

      Odd Orchestra was a fun composition mostly based on MIDI instruments from the Kontakt Library. With exception to a
      4 bar a cappella interlude and the guitar, all the sounds were made digitally.
