      Cyber Fjörd is a 4-minute electronic work for fixed media. Placed at the heart of Murray WOW’s Virtual Reality
      musical project ‘Melt’, the composition illustrates an imagined landscape that simultaneously evokes a grand
      discomfort. Cyber Fjörd highlights the awe and eerie power that comes with placing humans in vast virtual worlds.

      ‘Who on earth has the time for the real life?’ Just as electronic worlds are open for examination, so is the
      organic world. Even though the things we call ‘real’ seem palpable and relevant, this short song calls into
      question the completeness and satisfaction of the physical realm.
