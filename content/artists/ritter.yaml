  The first website Chris Ritter ever made was a Club Penguin screenshot blog in 2009. By that time, he had been playing
  piano for 5 years. In the years since then, the interests in technology and music have converged into an undergraduate
  career at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Music Technology as a combined degree. Today, he works
  as a software engineer for the music game studio Harmonix and is wrapping up the final year of his degree. While Chris
  writes and composes music, he is currently further exploring the use of technology in the process of composition and
  performance. Take a listen to "Decade"; The first sounds you hear represent posts on that very first Club Penguin blog.

      April 26, 2009 was the date where I made my first email address. The creation of this account enabled my first real
      digital engagement. Today, these online accounts tend to be a part of identity -- how we display ourselves to the
      world, converse, and deeply explore the things that move us.


      Developed in Fall 2019, "Decade" precedes "Always On." It is a sonification of 10 years of my online data,
      from 4/26/2009 to 4/26/2019. The sonification definition here is looser than "Always On," as some of the
      data-to-sound choices were more self-driven than data-driven. It is difficult to parse out much
      meaningful information about me from this piece. Particular synths and sounds rise to prominence and fall to
      silence as I use the platforms they represent more or less. Summers in which I attended sleepaway camp for months
      without technology are marked by about 3 seconds of respite each during the first half. Starting at 3:26 you can
      hear questions I asked Google with voice commands throughout the latter years. And yes, they store all of those
      MP3s...


      The gigabytes of data were sourced from all of my most active accounts from 2009 to 2019 (though some information
      had been lost to time), using JavaScript and Max for Live. The program video above features a brief look at the
      workflow used to make the piece.

      Interpersonal connectedness has changed. People will have conducted entire romantic relationships without ever
      meeting the subject of their infatuation in person. Even with the people we see in person, there is an implicit
      expectation that the ones close to use will be in touch online. Are emotional bonds formed over video chats, phone
      calls, and messages less valid?


      Composed entirely using samples from "Real Love" by John Lennon and "Digital Love" by Daft Punk, it builds texture
      and magnitude until it envelopes the listener in a Rossini Crescendo of sorts. The piece was composed as an
      exercise in Plunderphonics for Composition for Electronic Instruments, Fall 2019.

      "Wndrlnd" was composed using public domain audiobook recordings of various editions of "Alice's Adventures in
      Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll. The piece explores the use of voice as a textural, rhythmic, and compositional tool
      by accentuating vocal dynamic ranges, plosives, vowel sounds, and patterns found in regular speech. As all sounds
      in the piece are sourced from these audiobooks, artifacts from the readers' accents, recording fidelity, and
      dramatic reenactment all can be heard as the readers approach the same passages with different attitudes. Down the
      rabbit hole...
