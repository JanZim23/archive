    program_notes: >-
      The mighty sea rears its head often in Boston. Visions appear of sailors, both brave ones and naive ones, who take on the risk of dancing with the briny blue. There's no taming it completely; it has a power that is unparalleled on Earth. No one ever said that facing that power head on didn't have appeal, though.


      The 'Mariner's Sonata' is a very theatrical piece that moves along through themes of great contrast in intensity. Starting with a confident and stoic exposition, the music later jumps to several different realms between the serene and the apocalyptic. In alignment with Sonata form, the recapitulation brings the listener back to where the mariner started, but with much more unease. This mariner isn't going to take second chances next time; there's no room for cockiness in the middle of an unforgiving ocean.


      The 'Mariner's Sonata' was composed by Ryan in Doug Durant's Composition Seminar course at Northeastern in late 2015, though was not performed acoustically until 2020.
