      The mighty sea rears its head often in Boston. Visions appear of sailors, both brave ones and naive ones, who take
      on the risk of dancing with the briny blue. There's no taming it completely; it has a power that is unparalleled
      on Earth. No one ever said that facing that power head on didn't have appeal, though.


      The 'Mariner's Sonata' is a very theatrical piece that moves along through themes of great contrast in intensity.
      Starting with a confident and stoic exposition, the music later jumps to several different realms between the serene
      and the apocalyptic. In alignment with Sonata form, the recapitulation brings the listener back to where the mariner
      started, but with much more unease. This mariner isn't going to take second chances next time; there's no room for
      cockiness in the middle of an unforgiving ocean.


      The 'Mariner's Sonata' was composed by Ryan in Doug Durant's Composition Seminar course at Northeastern in late
      2015, though was not performed acoustically until 2020.

      "Imminence" is an acousmatic work that exploits the qualities of different types of resonances in order to create
      a feeling of uncertainty of environment; the intent for the first few minutes of the piece is fo the listener to
      not have the chance to assign an environmental space by having the resonances be deliberately contrasting. As the
      source of each type of resonance becomes less and less obvious as the piece continues, it becomes more difficult
      for any environment to be assigned, even momentarily, ultimately leading to an underlying building of tension which
      explodes and resolves when the space returns to the beginning.
