  Joseph Newmann is a musician, composer, performer and programmer, originally from Philadelphia, PA. Joseph began to
  find his compositional voice sometime in high school, where he performed in the jazz ensemble (alto saxophone), and
  choir (baritone). In his time at Northeastern University, Joseph has composed multiple pieces for fixed media, as well
  as a String Quartet. Most recently, Joseph has taken an interest in interactive real-time performance, looking to
  integrate technology into performance in more naturally responsive methods. Joseph has also performed with the
  Northeastern Choral Society, and the Blues and Fusion ensembles. He is also a part of the Boston-based neo-soul/jazz/funk

      “Warm up” is a piece that sets the performer in different “scenes”, which they navigate with improvisation. The
      piece looks to provide a new context for performers to improvise in, and each scene is created with a collection
      of sounds from the saxophone, from pitched tones to key clicks. The real interactive element of the piece involves
      the MAX patch moving through the scenes based on different rhythmic cues, although there is no predetermined order
      in which the scenes unfold.

      Written during composition lessons with Professor Daniel Strong Godfrey, “Finding Form” is the first String
      Quartet that Joseph composed. During the time of composition, Joseph was taking courses revolving around many
      different types of form and harmony, on one hand becoming versed in modal harmony in a Jazz Improvisation
      Workshop, and on the other performing Shenkerian analysis in a Music Analysis Seminar. Beginning with a mix of
      Lydian tonality and fugue form, this piece evolves with various iterations on the original theme, within and
      between the parts.

    program_notes: >-
      Joseph composed “Presidential Voices” in Composition for Electronic Instruments, where students were tasked with
      creating a piece using the voice as the source material. All of the samples that were used were recordings of
      various recent presidential speeches, from the last ten years or so. While beginning with relatively unprocessed
      material, as the piece goes on, the natural rhythmic and melodic patterns in the speeches are played upon, and
      brought to an extreme through pitch shifting, granular synthesis, delays and reverb.
