Kyle McCrosson is a musician, performer, songwriter, sound designer, and producer from Bayport, New York. Computer Science, Music Composition & Technology major. His interest in music began with piano lessons from the age of 6. From there, he learned the trumpet and the French horn in school, and taught himself to play the guitar and electric bass. In middle school, he began writing his own melodies on the piano-- something that has blossomed into a long love of songwriting. Throughout his five years at Northeastern studying computer science and music composition and technology, he has had the opportunity to compose for small ensembles, do sound design for student animations and plays, and expand his knowledge of sound synthesis techniques. His most current, ongoing project has been writing, producing, and recording electronic pop music under the stage-name 'Kale'.
