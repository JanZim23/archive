Computer Science, Music Composition & Technology major from 
Bayport, NY. My interest in music began with piano lessons. From there, I was 
able to learn a variety of other instruments and begin writing my own 
melodies. Throughout my five years at Northeastern, I have had the opportunity 
to compose for small ensembles, do sound design for student animations and 
plays, and expand my knowledge  of synthesis technique. My most current, 
ongoing project has been writing, producing, and recording electronic pop 
music under the stage-name 'Kale'.
