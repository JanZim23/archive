  "Rapping since the tender age of 11 and with over 80 live shows (Harvard, Miami to Montreal) under their belt, this
  physical manifestation of a purple flurp has established a unique audio/video aesthetic for themselves; saturated in
  thick coats of grape purple and manic beats. With tracks covering such sensitive topics as cycles of abuse, love, and
  the animal kingdom, (Austin) doesn't shy away from any subject, employing humorous could-be one liners to paint the
  world in their own surrealist vision. There’s a persistent sting of humor to their vocal delivery and song arrangement
  that’s erratic and endearing; it’s as if there’s this infectious smile hiding behind every song, grinning wide beneath
  a pair of gleeful, almost sarcastic rolling eyes." - Guilty Guide

      Inspired by the classic funk music that I loved growing up: George Clinton, Curtis Mayfield, Patrice Rushen and
      the Pure Funk soundtrack. The original synth harp sketch was written in 2017 in Montreal, dance oriented. This
      sketch was requested and used as the intro for an unrelated 2018 radio podcast about politics. Inspiration was
      taken from the comforting, home oriented folk music of Joanna Newsom, songs that take me back to safety. Mystery
      and magic was sparked by Andreas Vollenweider’s new age harp album “Behind the Gardens - Behind the Wall - Under the
      Tree....” Imagine pyramids, stars, late nights, early mornings, golden sand, and owl eyes shining in strange forests.

      Originally rapped over and arranged for warbally granular synth, glitchy hip hop drums and funky bass. This is the
      first song from the album “STEAL RASPBERRIES,” touching upon personal space, property rights, gender roles, abuse
      and boundaries. This piece was rearranged for string quartet and piano. This alternative vision is focused on a
      sense of loss and letting go of unwanted emotions (moving on), but also on adventure: the endless realities and
      possibilities. Imagine yourself as a waiter at a luxury retirement complex, stealing exotic yellow raspberries.

      Reminiscing on those who have passed, and birds. Birds are my alarm clock, reminding me in the morning that the
      world is alive. Regardless of death, and the constant reminders of it surrounding our everyday lives, birds arise
      like sunshine before the sun shines. Every morning they sing. They sing to each other, and in turn, to us. It would
      be a dream come true to bring back those that I’ve lost, to meet the relatives I've never met. At times it can
      feel like the friendships and relationships lost represent death in their own right. Birds still sing every morning
      though, waking us up. They don’t care- they’ll sing regardless. Think of birds in the morning!

      Inspired by a dream about fish taking over the world. Abridged version of 10 song project, composed mostly with
      glass instruments. Featuring my words with small vocal features from friends. This project is about maintaining
      faith. It can be tough to believe that good will come in the future, when the world is being taken over by killer
      fish. When one has lost control it can feel like the universe does not have its best intentions. In the dream I
      had a premonition: fish eggs were about to hatch by the ocean, near dozens of happy children. I had a feeling that
      death was near. The eggs hatched and the fish came to take over land and attack humans. This dream holds president
      in this reality as we pollute the ocean and eat fish with plastic in it. We drill for oil and act surprised when
      it pollutes our water. We overfish and deforest, creating opportunities for invasive species. We want control, but
      the reality is that the more control we get, the more we’re killing ourselves.
