  "Rapping since the tender age of 11 and with over 80 live shows (Harvard, Miami to Montreal) under their belt, this
  physical manifestation of a purple flurp has established a unique audio/video aesthetic for themselves; saturated in
  thick coats of grape purple and manic beats. With tracks covering such sensitive topics as cycles of abuse, love, and
  the animal kingdom, (Austin) doesn't shy away from any subject, employing humorous could-be one liners to paint the
  world in their own surrealist vision. There’s a persistent sting of humor to their vocal delivery and song arrangement
  that’s erratic and endearing; it’s as if there’s this infectious smile hiding behind every song, grinning wide beneath
  a pair of gleeful, almost sarcastic rolling eyes." - Guilty Guide

      Inspired by the classic funk music that I loved growing up (George Clinton, Superfly, Pure Funk, Patrice Rushen),
      the comfort zone- home oriented folk music of Joanna Newsom, and the new age Harp album “Behind the Gardens-Behind
      the Wall-Under the Tree” by Andreas Vollenweider. Magic!

      Originally rapped over and arranged for warbally granular synth, glitchy hip hop drums and funky bass. This song
      is off the album “STEAL RASPBERRIES,” touching upon personal space, property rights, gender roles, abuse and
      boundaries. This piece was arranged for string quartet and piano. Imagine yourself as a waiter at a luxury
      retirement complex, stealing exotic yellow raspberries.
